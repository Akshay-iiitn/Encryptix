Chatbot Description

The chatbot built here is an AI Author Chatbot that uses NLP to understand human-like text messages and then responds accordingly. The chatbot can listen to users in a conversational way, understanding their intentions and responding contextually with the input it receives. This design makes use of sophisticated language models to mimic human conversation.

These are the technologies used:

Transformers Library:

Objective: This NLP model works with state-of-the-art models such as transformers provided by Hugging Face.
Pipeline Function: It is the function of a pipeline available in the transformers library that loads text generation models like here loading the GPT-Neo model.
GPT-Neo Model:

Usage: GPT-Neo is an open-source replacement for OpenAI's GPT-3. Here it is used for generating text based on user input.
Model: EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B, a large-scale language model, is capable of generating reasonable and contextually consistent answers.
PyPDF2 Library:

Purpose: The PyPDF2 library is for extracting texts from PDF files.
Use Case: You can read the content of each page in a PDF and use that text for further processing or usage.
Google Colab & Google Drive:

Why: Provides an online way to run Python codes through Jupyter Notebooks, which is very good for machine learning tasks when the computational power is not trivial.
Google Drive Integration: The script is set up with Google Drive integration to fetch PDFs stored therein.
PDF Text Extraction Workflow:

The function extract_text_from_pdf reads and extracts text from each page in a given PDF file. This text can then be used as input to the chatbot or for further processing tasks.
Text Generation:

The generate_response function here uses the GPT-Neo model to produce text in response to user input. It is a critical tool for harnessing the conversational form into the chatbot script.
Interaction:

The user input is accepted in a continuous loop by the chatbot, and it will respond until the user types 'exit'. This instructs the AI to keep talking.
By combining state-of-the-art NLP models with text extraction, this powerful chatbot can understand and generate human-like text, serving as a foundation for many exciting applications such as customer support, ed-tech tools, and interactive agents.
